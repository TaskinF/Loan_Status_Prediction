# Loan Status Prediction
In this project , company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and
others. 
To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set. Since we are trying to predict class in the project, I am using the classification models in the
Supervised Learning section. And after doing the necessary evaluate models , Confusion Matrix , K-Fold cross validation , I find that the best model is Support Vector Machine. I am also creating a predictive system.
